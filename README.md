# DeepSeek Chat Exporter (Markdown, PDF & Image)

This is a Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey script for exporting DeepSeek chat conversations in Markdown, PDF, and image formats. The script adds three export buttons to the top-right corner of the DeepSeek chat interface for quick and easy conversation saving.

This is an English translation of <https://github.com/blueberrycongee/DeepSeek-Chat-Exporter> with several modifications:

- Extract original markdown for Assistant messages from React instead of incompletely translating from HTML back to markdown.
- Add a switch for whether to convert LaTeX delimiters to $$ format or not, and fix the conversion to correctly handle cases like LaTex inside lists, nested blockquotes, etc.
- Remove `<strong>` tags in markdown output, and use User/Assistant headers instead, with reasoning tokens in a quote block, like the website.
- Make the interface less obtrusive and remove animations, etc.
- Add chat title to exported files, and to filenames.
- Use ISO 8601 timestamps for filenames instead of UNIX.

## Important Notes

1. Ensure your browser allows pop-ups for PDF export functionality.
2. For long conversations, consider using landscape orientation when printing PDFs for best results.
3. For image export, ensure the page displays all content completely before exporting.
4. Script updates may be needed if the page structure changes to match new DOM structures.
